 MIAQuant_LEarn has been used for developing an automated system for ki67 segmentation and counting, described in:
"ki67 Nuclei detection and ki67-index estimation: a novel automatic approach based on human vision modeling"
BR Barricelli, E Casiraghi, J Gliozzo,et al.

They have been used to quantify all the histochemical images for the experiments, whose results are reported in 
 "Tumor-derived microRNAs induce myeloid suppressor cells and predict immunotherapy resistance in melanoma"
V Huber, V Vallacchi, V Fleming, et al.
